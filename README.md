# Philosophical-Quotes

## Update (3/22/2024)
Unfortunately, I have had to remove this script from my Ubuntu EC2 instance, as running the server was costing around $20/month. This was an unnecessary expense. The code still works, and we have some updated quotes. I am currently looking for a more cost-effective hosting solution.

## Random API Philosophical Quotes  
This repository contains the code for my random philosophical image quote API. To access an example, simply put `http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image` into your web browser. To use this in your own GitHub readme, use the following link for a generated image that takes in the current timestamp as a parameter, as well as any other parameters you want:

`http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image?timestamp=<current_timestamp>`
