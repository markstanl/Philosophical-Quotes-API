# Philosophical-Quotes
!ISSUES! 3/22/2024
I, unfortunately, have had to remove it from my ubunutu EC2 instance, as this single script cost around $20/month, based on how LONG the server is running. An entirely unecessary price.
What's next? I am going to try and find a way to host it on some other service hopefully for cheaper. The code STILL absolutely works and we have some updated quotes
## Random API Philosophical Quotes  
This repository contains the code for my random philosophical image quote API. To access an example, simply put http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image
into your web browser, to put this in your own github readme, use this link for a generated image that takes in the current timestamp as a parameter,
as well as any other parameters you want

### http://54.242.56.206:4000/generate_image?timestamp=<current_timestamp>

### Query Parameters
## Author
The first query parameter is the author of the quote. You can filter by the name of the 
philosopher who said the quote. The author parameter is case-insensitive.

?author=Aristotle
